      <h1>For Parents:</h1>
    <p>     Welcome to our website! Here, we encourage kids in elementary and middle school to reuse, reduce, and recycle in their daily lives.
      Our website has a ton of information about this topic. The kids get a chance to play games and earn points, which then motivates them
      to practice these three things in their day to day life. We hope your kids have a fun time and learn a thing or two while theyâ€™re here.
      To learn more about us, visit the About Us tab.</p>
