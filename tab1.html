<p>Waste is anything that we get rid of, throw away, or do not use and waste can affect the environment in many different ways. The environment includes everything around you such as plants, water, air, land, and much more. It is important for the environment to be healthy and being responsible with waste is one way you can help the Earth. To help protect the environment from waste, you can practice something called the three R's of waste management. The three R's stand for reduce, reuse, and recycle. Keep reading to learn all about how you can reduce, reuse, and recycle to help the environment.
